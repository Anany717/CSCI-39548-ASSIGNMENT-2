    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section id="about">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
           As an undergraduate teaching assistant at Hunter College, I support the computer science department in delivering high-quality education to students. I assist professors in preparing and grading assignments, conducting labs, and tutoring students in Python and other programming languages. I am also pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science at Hunter College, where I learn from leading experts in the field and participate in various projects and activities. I have a strong interest in applying computer science to solve real-world problems and create positive social impact.
Before joining Hunter College, I gained valuable experience in logistics and business development in different sectors. I worked as a business development consultant at 47Billion, a software development company that provides innovative solutions to clients in various industries. I helped identify and secure new business opportunities, negotiate contracts, and manage client relationships. I also worked as a management trainee at Root Natural, a sustainable food company that promotes healthy and organic products. I learned about the operations and challenges of the food industry, and contributed to improving the efficiency and quality of the supply chain and distribution network.
I have developed and honed skills such as Python programming, assistant teaching, logistics management, business development, communication, and teamwork through my education and work experience. I am always eager to learn new things, challenge myself, and collaborate with others. I am passionate about computer science, education, and social good, and I aspire to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive difference in the world.
